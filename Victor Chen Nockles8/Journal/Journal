5/9/17
Goal for today: Research how to add voice in java. Understand how servers and sockets work.
What I did today: I looked into examples and syntax for voice in java. Need to find a more cohesive tutorial 
				  to the voice without just copying code. I also continued to watch the basic messenger 
				  program tutorial on thenewboston youtube channel and wrote code to follow along with it.
				  The tutorial is almost done with setting up the server side of the program. 

5/11/17
Goal for today: Complete building the Server side groundwork and work on client side groundwork. (All based
				on java networking tutorial.
What i did today: I completed building the Serveb side program and it works fine. I split the project into two
				  different repositories since the server side and client side programs need to be running
				  at the same time on two computers. I shared that second client repository with the rest
				  of the group members. I also started the client side code.				  
				  
5/12/17
Goal for today: Complete building Client side of program and research more on how to add voice to java.
What I did today: I completed the client side of the program and straightened out the group skills/subgroups.
				Veeraj and I will present networking through video and voice chat respectively. Mahin and
				Gabriel will present reading files and uploading files through the chat program. Finally,
				Joyce will present database through SQL/PHP coding by saving the messages and/or the pictures
				depending on if it is possible to save image objects to PHPMyAdmin.
